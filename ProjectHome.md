Back in the day, radioteletype operators used to display the mark and space tones of their radios on an <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JuHhya4uq4&feature=share&list=UU5riV90FO3iPtgIMXavNnPA'>XY oscilloscope</a>. When the radio was on frequency, the two tones would be displayed at right angles, and their relationship would slowly rotate above and below frequency, making it intuitive to tune the radio correctly. Dedicating an oscilloscope to this function doesn't make much sense these days, particularly when software sound modes often display a similar tuning indicator. However, the on-screen displays don't look as cool as the old oscilloscopes. Since anything marginally worth doing is worth doing with a microprocessor, I've developed a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeumEiLyYsc&feature=share&list=UU5riV90FO3iPtgIMXavNnPA'>standalone RTTY display</a> based on the ATmega328 and developed on the arduino platform.
